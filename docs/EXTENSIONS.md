# Superset Extensions (.supx)

pyPASreporterGUI can host Superset extensions packaged as `.supx` bundles. The
Superset runtime loads these bundles from a dedicated extensions directory that
is created automatically during `pypasreportergui init` and `pypasreportergui run`.

## Extensions path

The Superset config generated by pyPASreporterGUI sets:

```
EXTENSIONS_PATH = "~/.pypasreportergui/supx"
```

Copy your `.supx` bundles into this directory (or the equivalent path when
`PYPASREPORTERGUI_HOME` is customized).

## Check status

Use the CLI to verify extension support and bundle counts:

```
pypasreportergui extensions status
```

This command reports whether the pinned Superset checkout includes extension
runtime signals and shows the resolved `EXTENSIONS_PATH`.

## Content Security Policy (CSP)

Superset extensions use Module Federation, which requires a relaxed CSP.
pyPASreporterGUI configures Talisman with the baseline CSP used by Superset's
extension tooling (including `script-src` with `'unsafe-eval'` and
`'unsafe-inline'`). Review these settings if you operate in a more restrictive
security environment.
